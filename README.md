# Glutinous


# What is it?
This application was developed with one other person. The purpose of this app is to give another layer of 
help for people who are celiac or gluten intolerant. It is built using React and Typescript, using the 
Material UI library for components for mobile support. 

# How does it work?
A user can take a picture of the Ingredients list, the app then uses the Tesseract OCR to identify the ingredients. 
It then takes those words and feeds it into an AI model ( Chat ), and returns the result. 

 A user can also manually search an ingredient in our search bar to see if it is gluten free or not. 

 # Is it done?
 Not yet, we have only done the barebones, getting the OCR and AI model to work. Other pages not yet implemented, 
 but we have plans to completely revamp this project. Hoping to create our own AI model to keep costs down and to 
have a database of previous results for quicker response times. Also we would like to refactor our code, it was 
our first project when we had little experience with react, now that is no longer the case, we would like to retry 
and improve.
